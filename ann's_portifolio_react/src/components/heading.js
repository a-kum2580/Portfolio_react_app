      <h1>Anna's PortfolioðŸ˜Ž</h1>
      <p>Hei! Welcome to my portfolio</p>
      <p>I'm a second-year Computer Science student with an interest in Embedded Systems and Robotics Engineering. I like trying out complex problems and as i enrich my knowledge on Arduino and microcontrollers. There's something satisfying about writing code and seeing it control hardware in the real world.</p>
      <p>"If it works don't touch it."(If it doesnot make sense definetely touch it.)ðŸ˜œ</p>
