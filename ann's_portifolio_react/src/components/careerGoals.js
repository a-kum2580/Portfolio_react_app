            In the short term, I aim to secure an internship at a leading tech company to gain hands-on experience in hardware-software integration, microcontroller programming, and real-time systems. Long-term, I aspire to establish my own technology consultancy firm, focusing on sustainable and ethical innovations in embedded systems, robotics, and AI-driven automation.
